About Me 

I'm a social science graduate with a keen interest in how technology shapes human behavior and decision-making. My background in behavioral science, combined with growing technical literacy, allows me to bridge the gap between people and systems.
I'm particularly fascinated by behavioral science and artificial intelligence – exploring how AI can be designed with human-centered principles and how we can better understand technology's impact on society.
Currently, I'm developing my data analysis skills (building on foundations from university) and learning about cybersecurity – not as a specialization, but because I believe everyone should understand how to protect their digital information in an increasingly connected world.
With hands-on experience as a Systems Development Learner at Engen and a background mentoring in AI literacy programs, I enjoy working at the intersection of technology, research, and practical problem-solving.
🌱 Currently exploring: Data analysis & visualization, AI applications in social research, digital security fundamentals
🔭 Interested in: International development, policy research, human-centered technology design, and the evolving role of data in understanding complex social issues
📝 I also enjoy documenting what I learn and sharing insights through writing.

⚡ Fun fact: I blend my psychology background with tech — because tech is as much about people as it is about systems.
