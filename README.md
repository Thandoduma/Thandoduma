About Me 

I'm a tech enthusiast passionate about creating user-centered applications. My interests include product design, cybersecurity, and programming.

With a background in Industrial Psychology and hands-on experience as a Systems Development Learner at Engen, I'm focused on building secure, user-friendly applications.
I'm currently part of the ALX Backend Web Development program, and I also enjoy documenting my journey and what I learn through writing. 

🌱 Currently learning: Cybersecurity (SOC Analysis, threat intelligence & Threat Detection), Backend Development (APIs, Databases), artificial intelligence and Cloud Fundamentals

🔭 Working on: cool projects for my portfolio that reflect my interests
